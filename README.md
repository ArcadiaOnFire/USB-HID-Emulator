# USB-HID-Emulator
A USB Keyboard/Mouse Emulator for Rooted Android Devices

Incredibly rudimentary as of currently, with some questionable UI decisions that I cannot seem to change at this current time.
Device MUST be rooted, tested on Pixel 7 Pro. 

First get USB Gadget Tool (https://github.com/tejado/android-usb-gadget), open app, uncheck the /config/usb_gadget/g1, hit + icon at top right, select "Mouse & Keyboard", check the box. 
Further documentation will probably be written soon.

This code is 100% written by AI (ChatGPT), I coded nothing. I am not responsible for any damages done to your device, though I would figure it's probably impossible that this app alone could break anything.
